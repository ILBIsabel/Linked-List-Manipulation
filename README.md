# Linked-List-Manipulation
This project implements a C program that demonstrates core operations on singly linked lists, including node creation, insertion, and selective deletion. It showcases the use of dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and structured testing of edge cases to ensure correctness and robustness.

# Overview
Developed a comprehensive C program to manage linked lists, incorporating functions for:

Creating new nodes

Inserting nodes at the beginning of the list

Deleting every second node in the list

Implemented dynamic memory allocation to handle variable-sized data structures and ensure efficient memory usage.

Designed and coded a function to traverse and selectively delete every second node in the list, optimizing manipulation without creating memory leaks.

Utilized pointers and structures to maintain and manipulate linked list nodes, demonstrating strong proficiency with core data structure concepts.

# Testing and Validation
The program was tested against multiple scenarios to ensure its correctness:

Empty list

Single-node list

Two-node list

Odd-numbered list

Even-numbered list

These tests validate both functionality and stability, helping ensure that no segmentation faults or memory issues occur during operation.

# Development Highlights
Applied debugging techniques and iterative improvements to enhance reliability and performance.

Focused on safe memory management, with proper allocation and deallocation of nodes.

Created a maintainable, readable structure using modular function design.

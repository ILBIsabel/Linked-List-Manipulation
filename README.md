# Linked-List-Manipulation
Linked List Manipulation in C

Developed a comprehensive C program to manage linked lists, incorporating functions for creating, inserting, and deleting nodes.

Implemented dynamic memory allocation to handle variable-sized data structures and ensured efficient memory usage.

Designed and coded a function to traverse and selectively delete every second node in the list, optimizing the linked list manipulation process.

Utilized pointers and structures to maintain and manipulate linked list nodes effectively, demonstrating a strong understanding of data structures.

Conducted thorough testing with various edge cases, including empty lists, single-node lists, and lists with odd and even numbers of nodes, to ensure program reliability and correctness.

Applied debugging techniques and iterative improvements to enhance program performance and robustness.
